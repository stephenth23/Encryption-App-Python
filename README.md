# encryption_app


This mini-application is created in python, while I wanted to create a way to communicate with my cousin without others to understand us. :)

The app takes the text you write, and then generate a random encryption key, and with that will encrypt the message. The receiver will read the message only knowing the encryption key and the algorithm behind it.
